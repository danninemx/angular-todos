## Next steps

Given the time straints, some aspects were left out of scope. Additional work would improve such areas as:

- responsive design
- error handling
- form validations
- animations
- naming and type/interface
- stricter type check
- use of appropriate directives
- parameterized CSS
- state management
- DRY
- actual styling
