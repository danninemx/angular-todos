## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Next steps

Given the purpose and time straint, some aspects were left out of scope. Additional work would improve such areas as:

- Responsive design
- Error handling
- Form validations
- Animations
- Naming and type/interface
- Stricter type check
- Use of appropriate directives
- Parameterized CSS
- Accessibility
- State management
- DRY code
- Styling
